# Git Version Control Basics

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS portfolio website used to simulate Git collaboration between two developers: **Tom** and **Jerry**.

## Git Workflow Tasks

* Tom adds a "Blog" link to the navigation.
* Jerry adds contact info in the footer.

## Files

* `index.html`: Main HTML file
* `styles.css`: Basic styling
* `script.js`: Optional JS for interaction

## Note

> This collaboration is **simulated by a single developer** on **one Ubuntu machine**, using a **single Git user/account**. The tasks of **Tom** and **Jerry** are actioned by performing their respective tasks as separate commits, representing a collaborative workflow within a solo environment.

> 📸 Screenshots provided in this README clearly indicate which task was completed by Tom and which by Jerry, to make the collaboration simulation easy to follow.
